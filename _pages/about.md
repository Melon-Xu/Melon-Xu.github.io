I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science at Stony Brook University, advised by [Prof. Chao Chen](https://chaochen.github.io/). I am also working closely with [Dr. Xiaoling Hu](https://huxiaoling.github.io/).

Before my Ph.D., I received my B.E. degree from Wuhan University in 2022, worked happily with [Prof. Jiayi Ma](https://sites.google.com/site/jiayima2013/) and [Linfeng Tang](https://github.com/Linfeng-Tang).

I am broadly interested in medical image analysis, topological data analysis, generative models and multi-modal learning.
